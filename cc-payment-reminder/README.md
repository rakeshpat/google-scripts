This script works with a Google Sheet I created to send a reminder via email when a credit card payment is due.

My Google sheet allows me to select how to pay back an expense (in weekly, fortnightly or monthly frequencies) and uses this information to calculate when a payment is due (column A), how many days until a payment needs to be made (column B) and how much to pay back (column C).

A trigger has been set up so that this is checked everyday and if a payment is due on the day, an email will sent to me with the total amount due for that day.
